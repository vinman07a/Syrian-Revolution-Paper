@article{sectarian,
Abstract = {This article challenges the sectarian narrative of Syria’s current civil war, which relies on several false assumptions about the nature of political identity. It first questions how sectarian the uprising and civil war actually are, suggesting that the conflict is ‘semi-sectarian’, given the multiple other fault lines of contention, notably class, ideology and other non-sect, sub-state ties. It then draws on the theoretical debates between primordialists, ethno-symbolists and modernists to historicise political identity development in Syria. In doing so, it reasserts the modernist case, emphasising how political identities in Syria, both national and sectarian, have developed in a complex interrelated manner in the modern era and how the recent violent mobilisation of sectarian identity is the result of long- and short-term structural, economic, socio-cultural and political factors rather than unchanging ancient animosities. Of these, the most vital remain structural changes and elit},

abstract={Since the stifling of the masses four years earlier, the ongoing war in Syria had seen an array of horrid developments. One of the most awful outcomes of the conflict had been the way it turned into a sectarian war. Syria attracted world attention as its masses rose in a popular uprising, enliven by the triumph of Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions, against the government demanding democracy. However, what followed was a violent crackdown by the Syrian government on its citizens which later on turned into armed rebellion. Nevertheless, the happenings in Syria didn ' t go unnoticed internationally. The supporters and those in opposition of the regime and Syrian rebels both, tried to defend their preferred groups by accusing and denouncing the other. As the conflict grew more and more intense, the war of accusations and propagandas also increased at the international level. However, what followed in between the turn of events inside Syria and externally, paved way for sectarian animosity leading to sectarian strife damaging the unity in diversity of Syria severely. The paper aims at explicating how the turn of events, overbearing approach of the government and foreign interventions led to sectarian crisis in Syria.},

abstract ={This intervention concerns the ways in which law and violence are being reorganized in Rojava. Based on observations and interviews I conducted in the Jazira canton of Rojava, I argue that, through democratic autonomy, the Rojava revolution poses a challenge to the politics of sovereignty and biopolitics. While democratic autonomy involves the institutionalization of radical democracy, radical democracy needs to be defended against attacks of capital, state, and patriarchy. The question of how such defense can be organized without reproducing the “magic” of the state and law at an everyday level is crucial for the revolution. I address the debates and practices in Rojava developing around this question and conclude that, rather than speaking about a model in Rojava, we should speak of a movement residing in the dialectic between state-ness and society.},

Abstract = {This Comment details the void in international legislation with respect to the world's largest threat to peace currently, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Territorial boundaries ground the international legal system, inhibiting the armed intervention required to successfully combat ISIS. The United Nations (U.N.) Charter permits armed intervention in self-defense or collective self-defense and armed intervention sanctioned by the Security Council, but neither model allows States to defeat ISIS. Without armed intervention to stop the expansion of Islamic militants, terrorist organizations like ISIS will continue to flourish. The U.N. Security Council is required to maintain international peace and security and therefore, the Security Council must set clear standards that allow States to combat ISIS with the force of law. First, armed intervention must be a last resort that is limited to threats involving a high severity and probability of mass atrocities. Second, armed inter},

Abstract = {The war against the Islamic State has seen some unusual alliances: the United States and European forces currently support the Kurdish positions in Bashur (Iraq) and Rojava (Syria). What would have been considered unlikely two years ago has, triggered by the threat potential of ISIS, become the most plastic show of neorealist concepts such as balance of power, alliance formation on the basis of shared enemy conceptions, and the relevance of geopolitical spheres of influence. This paper aims to uncover the reasons, consequences, and nature of the alliance between the United States, Turkey, the Syrian-Kurdish revolutionary movement PYD (Democratic Union Party), and the Iraq-Kurdish parties of the KDP (Kurdistan Democratic Party) and PUK (Patriotic Union of Kurdistan). The guiding hypothesis of the paper understands the "state"to be an outdated concept for understanding the conflict.
